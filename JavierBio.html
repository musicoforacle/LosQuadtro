				<p class="text-center">Hola which is hello in Spanish, my name Javier Medina I am 19 year old. I am Dreamer because of  the DREAM Act,  which gives opportunity to  undocumented individuals who were brought here young and that have been living here for 5 years and who want to pursue a higher education. I am a recent graduate high school, currently I am attending Year Up. Year is a non-profit program that gives an opportunity to  young adults of the age of 18 to 24 to work in a corporate world. Besides working in a office, Year Up gives 28 college credit through ACE. Year Up teaches the students about hardware, software, coding and business etiquette. Having soft skills is very important because having the tech skills is not enough to get notice. In Year Up there are 3 tracks that you can choose from which are hardware , software and coding. The track I am taking is software which is focus on the excel, microsoft word and powerpoint. I am familiar with hardware field due to my training and internship during high school. My training was done by Genesys Works, it is an non-profit that trains high school students in IT and accounting to work in corporate companies. I had the chance to intership at Baker & McKenzie, during my internship I worked with many different people and talked to them in a professional manner. I was the IT intern and I had to work with printers, laptops mobile devices and applications. I had to fix or replace the user's hardware or software. Besides getting an internship by Genesys works, I received a certification (Cisco IT essentials). Besides working I volunteer for Junior Achievement. The event that I volunteer for was “High School Heroes”, is when high school students teach an elementary class about different businesses and how it affects their community. I have taught a class of 2nd, 3rd and 5th graders with a group of  3 including me. Which gave me the perspective of a teacher and had to come up with a lesson plan.  This is what I have done and there is much more to get done,  I am still young and ambitious. Thank you.</p>
