				<p class="text-center">My name is Nick Watkins and I am a driven, 19 year old with a passion for IT. I am currently enrolled in a year-long training program called “Year-Up” that primarily focuses on IT skills such as web development, hardware troubleshooting, and much more. I have entered the Web Development track at Year Up during my time here, which allows me to have access to great opportunities. These great opportunities include having access to earning a nano-degree through a program called Udacity. I have also enrolled in a website called CodeAcademy to further my learning with web development. From the period of September 2015 to January 2016, I have been able to become proficient in the languages of HTML and CSS. This is a milestone I’m very proud of. My passions besides IT is audio setup. I have experience with setting up speakers, microphones, etc. for venues as well as professionally mixing and mastering songs for artists. I have been making music since I was 13 years old and ever since then, it has been a true passion of mines. I plan to continue on my path of IT by obtaining my degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago as I continue to become a respected professional in my respected field. I one day hope to bridge the gap between my loves for coding and creating music and work in a job where I can utilize both of those skills. </p>
