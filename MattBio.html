				<p class="text-center">Hello my name is Matthew McDaniel and I am currently in the Year Up program. My current interest include technology, gaming, and working with electronics. I have moderate coding experience and I have built two computers on my own but I am always willing to learn more. I have also modified several prebuilt computers and altered their specifications to my liking. My current project includes building a third system. This current system that I am building will be able to play all games that were released in 2015 and the years before. One day I hope to build a computer that will be future proof for a number of years. This means that I will not have to upgrade any hardware parts for a number of years, this is the dream I’ve had for a long while. I’ve done much research in order to build my dream PC. I hope in the coming years that this dream will come true. Some other things that I’m working on are modifying my phone, I have a Samsung galaxy note for that I have modified many times now. I’m able to take my phone and give it capabilities of other phones that it normally wouldn’t have such as having a special at that would normally be on another brand of phone or speeding up my phone CPU. I work on my computer most of the time so when most people need to reach me they usually send me an email. I usually am in the house, if not helping my grandmother with the house work. I’m also helping my aunt learn the internet with her new computer. I pretty much help everybody in the house with anything technical, it can be frustrating at time but I’m happy as long as I’m some help to people. In recent years I have gotten into reading. I find myself reading light novel that I find on the internet and reading hundreds of chapters at a time. I feel that this is a good habit that I picked up because I really wasn’t into reading until now.</p>
