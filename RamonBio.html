				<p class="text-center">Welcome to my page, my name is Ramon Romero and I am 23 years old. I am the oldest of three with a younger brother in elementary school and a sister in college. I’m currently attending a program called Year Up after deciding I needed a career and not just a job. I started in September of 2015 and expect to graduate by July of 2016. What is Year Up is a question you might be asking yourself. Well I’ll tell you, Year Up is a yearlong program that consists of six months in a class learning tech skills and soft skills in order to become successful in corporate America and not only do they teach you these skills we get to practice them as well in a six month internship in a variety of corporate settings depending on your track choice. While attending class you not only gain these skills but one can also earn up to 28 college credits that are transferable and potentially obtain a certificate depending on their track choice. By the end of Year Up I expect to have my A+ CompTIA certification along with being able to build different type of computers whether it’s a computer meant for music or a gaming computer. Outside of the program I like to ride my bicycle with a couple of friends if the weather allows it. I also enjoy playing baseball even if it’s just playing catch or shooting a basketball around to pass the time. I plain and simply enjoy being outside even if it’s to just shovel some snow. When I’m not outside I like to listen to music whether it’s some classic rock like Pink Floyd or something newer like Nirvana or System of a Down. Just recently I started picking up the guitar because of my new taste of music. Well that’s enough about me for now thanks for reading and have a great day!</p>
